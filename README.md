# IOT Based Drone

#Currently in Devloping Stage :(  

# Abstract:
Nowadays Drones applications are in many places like in agriculture , surveillance , private institute etc . But Drones available in market are either expensive or not so user-friendly in terms of controlling it or getting useful work and can also required professional training . So our project is to redesign the drone to reduce the cost and connected to internet so people can control or interact through internet using mobile phones.
